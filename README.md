## 1. Overview

CommandX is an orbital mechanics simulation platform built to explore satellite constellation management, proximity operations, and mission trajectory optimization. It integrates Space-Track TLE data with GNC (Guidance, Navigation, and Control) algorithms as a hands-on learning project in orbital mechanics, ML systems, and DevOps.

### Key Features

- **Genetic Algorithm Optimizer** — Multi-objective fuel-optimal trajectory optimization over N-dimensional search space
- **Extended Kalman Filter (EKF)** — 6-DOF orbit estimation with noise cancellation for state awareness
- **Monte Carlo IV&V** — 1,000 stochastic docking simulations with 3-sigma confidence intervals
- **TLE Data Pipeline** — Parses live 3LE Space-Track catalogs for 17,000+ active satellite records
- **Streaming ML Engine** — Async telemetry buffering with real-time ML inference backend

---

## Project Background

CommandX grew out of multiple satellite-ops simulations I built to study how telemetry architecture affects anomaly surfacing and operator workflows.  
In 2026, I refactored those prototypes into a cohesive mission-control stack with:

- A simulated satellite bus and configurable telemetry channels
- ML-based anomaly surfacing over streaming data
- A Dockerized FastAPI backend ready to plug into dashboards

The goal is to approximate real mission-control constraints while remaining easy to run and extend.

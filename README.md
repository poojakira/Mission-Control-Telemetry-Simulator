## ⚡ The Problem: Orbital Congestion

As of 2024, there are over 17,000 active satellites and hundreds of thousands of debris particles in Low Earth Orbit (LEO). Legacy mission planning tools often:

- **Ignore Live Traffic**: Planning in a vacuum leads to conjunction risks.
- **Simplistic Physics**: Failing to account for J2 perturbations or atmospheric drag.
- **Manual Optimization**: Relying on human intuition for complex multi-constraint transfers.

## 🚀 The Solution: CommandX

CommandX addresses these challenges by automating the "Sense-Analyze-Act" loop for orbital assets:

- **Live Traffic Awareness**: Automatically parses live `3LE` catalogs to map orbital density.
- **Physics-First Optimization**: Uses Genetic Algorithms to find fuel-efficient trajectories that avoid radiation belts and high-drag zones.
- **Robust Estimation**: Implements an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) to maintain state awareness even with noisy sensor telemetry.

## 🙋 My Contributions (Rhutvik Pachghare)

> This is a collaborative project. Here is a precise breakdown of what I personally built:

| Domain | My Contribution |
|---|---|
| **GNC & Orbital Physics** | Implemented `gnc_kalman.py` — a full 6-DOF Extended Kalman Filter for real-time orbit state estimation from noisy sensor telemetry |
| **CI/CD & Test Infrastructure** | Designed the GitHub Actions CI workflow (`.github/workflows/`) and the full pytest suite in `tests/` |
| **Documentation & Architecture** | Authored the full README, engineering focus area breakdown, and CODEOWNERS domain attribution |
| **Repository Restructure** | Organized file layout, added `k8s/` Kubernetes manifests, `ec2-user-data.sh` EC2 deployment script |

---

## 🧠 Technical Highlights

- **EKF for 6-DOF orbit estimation**: Real-world noise cancellation using Extended Kalman Filters.
- **GA over N-dim search space**: Fuel-optimized Hohmann transfers evading radiation zones.
- **Monte Carlo IV&V with 1,000 randomized scenarios**: Production-grade verification proving Mission Assurance.
- **Real-Time Data Pipelines**: Asynchronous streaming thread architecture buffering high-frequency telemetry into an ML backend.

## ⚡ GPU & Accelerated Computing Scalability

While the current prototype utilizes CPU-based Scikit-Learn logic, this architecture is designed to scale directly onto **NVIDIA Hardware**.

- **Monte Carlo Simulation**: The IV&V logic is naturally parallelizable; transitioning to **CUDA/CuPy** would allow millions of stochastic docking trials in milliseconds.
- **Inference Serving**: The `BatchInferenceEngine` is structurally identical to **NVIDIA Triton Inference Server**. Dropping in TensorRT/ONNX models for real-time cyber anomaly detection would exploit GPU memory bandwidth, maintaining strict 20ms SLA latency.
